    <h1><b>Internet Protocols and IP Address</b></h1>
    <p>
      <b>Internet Protocols (IP)</b> are rules or standards that allow devices
      to communicate over the internet. Their main <b>function</b> is to define
      how data is packaged, addressed, transmitted, and received. <br /><br />
      Examples of common internet protocols include:
      <b>HTTP</b> (HyperText Transfer Protocol), <b>HTTPS</b> (Secure HTTP),
      <b>FTP</b> (File Transfer Protocol), <b>TCP/IP</b> (Transmission Control
      Protocol/Internet Protocol), and <b>SMTP</b> (Simple Mail Transfer
      Protocol).
    </p>

    <h2><b>Types and Versions of IP Addresses</b></h2>
    <p>
      An <b>IP address</b> is a unique string of numbers used to identify
      devices on a network. It allows devices to send and receive data across
      the internet.<br /><br />
