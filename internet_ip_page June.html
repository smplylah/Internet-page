    <h1><b>Internet Protocols and IP Address</b></h1>
    <p>
        <b>Internet Protocols (IP)</b> are rules or standards that allow devices to communicate over the internet. Their main <b>function</b> is to define how data is packaged, addressed, transmitted, and received. <br><br>
        Examples of common internet protocols include:
        <b>HTTP</b> (HyperText Transfer Protocol), <b>HTTPS</b> (Secure HTTP), <b>FTP</b> (File Transfer Protocol), <b>TCP/IP</b> (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), and <b>SMTP</b> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
    </p>

    <h2><b>Types and Versions of IP Addresses</b></h2>
    <p>
        An <b>IP address</b> is a unique string of numbers used to identify devices on a network. It allows devices to send and receive data across the internet.<br><br>
        There are two major versions of IP addresses: <b>IPv4</b> and <b>IPv6</b>.<br>
        <b>IPv4</b> uses a 32-bit numeric format like <b>192.168.0.1</b>, and it supports around 4.3 billion addresses.<br>
        <b>IPv6</b> uses a 128-bit format like <b>2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334</b>, allowing for an almost unlimited number of unique addresses.<br><br>
        <b>IPv4</b> is still widely used today, but <b>IPv6</b> is being adopted rapidly due to the massive growth of internet-connected devices.
